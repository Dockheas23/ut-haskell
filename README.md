# ut-haskell
Unquantifiable Treasures - Haskell Microservice


##Setup

Assuming you have a standard haskell dev environment set up with cabal, using
something like the [haskell platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/contents.html).

`cd` in to the source directory and you can
run these commands to get started:

`cabal install`

`ut-haskell`

This will start the service at http://localhost:8000

To run some tests while in the project source directory:

`cabal test`
